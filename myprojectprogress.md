I haven't really done any project progress. 

Just to reiterate my project would be some sort of integration between yacs.me and ratemyprofessor to allow the ratemyprofessor functionality to be available on yacs.me. At this point I'd probably just look up similar projects to this with other schools and see if they have anything that needs to be improved or can be learned from.
